# 🎬 Netflix Clone

A **responsive clone of Netflix’s landing page**, built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project focuses on recreating the visual structure and layout of the Netflix homepage as closely as possible — no JavaScript, backend, or interactivity involved.

It's a great beginner-friendly project to practice **HTML semantics**, **CSS positioning**, **flexbox**, **grid**, **responsive design**, and working with **background images and overlays**. The layout adapts for both desktop and mobile views, aiming to reflect the clean and modern aesthetic of Netflix.
